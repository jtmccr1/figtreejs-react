# figtreejs-react

React components for tree visualization.

This started as an experiment in immutable data, and a comparision of ways to work with d3 and react. It is a react-first version of the work we've done in [figtree.js](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree.js).

Due to time constraints I do not have time to develope this project further. I may revisit it in the future if there is time/interest.
